# Opulai

<!-- Long description here -->

## Inspiration

In the rise of online only banking and digital currency, what role do community banks play? It likely won't be getting Grandma hooked on the next Altcoin, but it may be helping her not get scammed out of her life savings. The lifeblood of community banks is drawn from client relationships, but in a time where face-to-face connection is strained, relationships become difficult to foster. Opulai was motivated to forge online interactions between bankers and clients by providing a secure peer-to-peer meeting portal. 

## What it does

The web application we created simulates an online banking portal, where both bankers and clients have access to a dashboard that they can communicate through. The application steps through the pages seen in the video and repository.

## How we built it

The web application was built from scratch using ReactJS, TypeScript, and SCSS. The final design was hosted on the Google Cloud through Firebase. 

## Challenges we ran into

The initial design was to implement the Zoom SDK for the meeting portal, however we realized that utilizing Zoom would pose many security threats down the line. We opted to implement a peer-to-peer WebRTC model that would be deployed on Heroku. This implementation never made it into the final web application, as it continued to crash on Heroku. The final design was much less featureful yet no less beautiful, with more time it would have been both.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We believe that the greatest accomplishment we made was simply the idea. It's not everyday that one brainstorms and arrives upon a problem that is both tangible and solvable. Even though we didn't complete the dream of a perfect end-to-end web app, we did communicate a solution powerfully through visual design. Through elegantly placed divs and fashionable hex color codes, we are proud of the UX and UI narrative written during this most fine Hackathon.

## What we learned

We learned that code can bring people together, including two brothers (we are siblings!). Who knew that forgetting to include node_modules in your git ignore could invoke such a laugh at 3:00 am? Well we certainly did not! HooHacks truly exposed our strengths and weaknesses, showing us where we need to grow in technical expertise and as team players, and for that we are grateful.

## What's next for Opulai

Opulai is hungry for customer discovery and further development on its MVP. We would love to see if this project would be a welcomed addition to the market, which would only be uncovered through consultation with our local banks. After that, who knows? Maybe the Y Combinator (albeit a very very long way away)!
