# Opulai

In the rise of online only banking and digital currency, what role do community banks play? It likely won't be getting Grandma hooked on the next Altcoin, but it may be helping her not get scammed out of her life savings. The lifeblood of community banks is drawn from client relationships, but in a time where face-to-face connection is strained, relationships become difficult to foster. Opulai was motivated to forge online interactions between bankers and clients by providing a secure peer-to-peer meeting portal.
